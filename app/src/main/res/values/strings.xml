    <string name="siam"><b>School of Advanced Science</b> (SAS), a platform for intellectuals in VIT,
        is pledged to internationally acclaimed research and inventive instruction with a priority on
        disciplinary rigor and establish academic achievement. SAS comprises three academic departments
        spanning Mathematics, Physics &amp; Chemistry with faculty strength of 110, 46 &amp; 72 respectively
        (total 226). The School offers M.Phil and Ph. D. research Programmes in all these disciplines and
        Masterâ€™s Programmes in Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry.\n\n<b>SIAM-VIT</b> aims at dispensing
        the required tools and knowledge for students to excel in fields
        of applied mathematics such as computational science, forensics, cryptography etc. It provides a
        bridge for students to apply the classroom knowledge to real-world applications and push the
        boundaries of their curriculum to explore their field of interest through projects, research,
        industrial visits and internships. It is the only chapter in VIT that takes all the branches
        under its wings and therefore has a huge outreach.
